FitzHugh Nagumo Oscillator network, interlayer synchronization, local order parameter, mean phase velocity portrait 
This Program is written to simulate the timevarying topology change of the FitzHugh Nagumo Oscillator network
1. Spacetime Plot data, Local Order Parameter, and Mean Phase Velocity portrait 
2. Synchronization error for varying interlayer links and switching times
3. stochasticity of switching time, interlayer coupling strength, number of interlayer links from switching to switching
4. White noise and coloured noise
